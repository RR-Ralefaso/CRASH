# CRASH: Image Recognition AI

**Crash** is an image recognition tool built using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** models. It is designed to identify objects in real-time and output detection data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Current Status:** The project is functional, but the text output feature is currently writing data for every single frame recorded. We are working on optimizing this to only output significant detection events.

## Features

* **Real-time Recognition**: Powered by state-of-the-art YOLO models.
* **Open Source**: The source code is open for anyone to use, modify, and improve.
* **Detection Logging**: (In Development) Outputs recognized objects into a `.txt` file for data analysis.

## Contributing & License

Crash is open to everyone! You are free to change and build upon the source code.
**Requirement:** Please provide proper credit to the original author and any other contributors.
